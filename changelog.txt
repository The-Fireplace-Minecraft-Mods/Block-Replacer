Updated to 1.13.2
Added the ability to retrogen at any time
Changed how the generation works: Rather than working when the world first generates, it now works when the world first loads with the mod loaded. What this means: Loading this mod on existing worlds will now perform retrogen, and it should be more reliable about replacing some mods' worldgen.
